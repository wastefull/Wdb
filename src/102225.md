# Scientific Data Panel

✅ COMPLETED:
* Added green color (#bdd4b7 pastel, #5a9a4d high contrast) to the design system with full accessibility support
* Replaced Confidence pill labels with icons:
  - High confidence: CheckCircle2 (green checkmark)
  - Medium confidence: AlertCircle (amber warning)
  - Low confidence: XCircle (red X)
* Updated globals.css with green color correlates for high contrast and no-pastel modes
* Scientific Data panel now uses green background (#bdd4b7 light, #2a2f27 dark)
* Applied green color to BETA pill label in title bar
* Applied green color to ADMIN button when admin mode is active

# Donut Chart
## Weird behavior
* When you click the box around the donut chart, it highlights the box with a dark outline, as if clicking is supposed to do something. I would like to prevent this.

## Mobile issues
* The tagline for the donut chart is still too small to be read in mobile.
* Let's not have the chart be interactable in mobile, it's buggy.

# Data
## Brainstorming next steps
* We're going to need to figure out how we're going to update the Scientific Data panel UI to reflect that we will be adding Compostability and Reusability as calculated categories with their own uncertainty values and considerations.
* We also need to consider how we'll update the UI to enable data management for these new data categories.
