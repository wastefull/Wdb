# **ROADMAP.md**

*A development roadmap for integrating Wastefull's data science methodology into the WasteDB platform.*

---

## **Overview**

**Project:** WasteDB
**Organization:** Wastefull
**Purpose:** Build an open, accessible, and scientifically rigorous materials database that communicates both the *practical* and *theoretical* sustainability of materials across three dimensions: **Recyclability (CR)**, **Compostability (CC)**, and **Reusability (RU)**.

This roadmap outlines the technical milestones and feature dependencies required to evolve WasteDB from a user-facing sustainability tracker into a dual-layer scientific-public system that fully implements the Wastefull methodology described in the *Statistical and Accessibility Methodology White Paper* and accompanying methodology whitepapers (CR-v1, CC-v1, RU-v1, VIZ-v1).

---

## **System Vision**

WasteDB will:

1. Present **practical, lay-friendly data** (0–100 compostability, recyclability, reusability scores).
2. Maintain a **scientific backend layer** with normalized parameters for all three dimensions, confidence intervals, and source weighting.
3. Allow researchers and admins to compute, audit, and update scores via the in-app *Data Processing View*.
4. Keep all scientific methods transparent, versioned, and linked to public whitepapers.
5. Communicate uncertainty visually through the **Hybrid Quantile-Halo Visualization Model** (VIZ-v1).

### **1. Data Model Integration** ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Introduce the WasteDB scientific data layer without disrupting the public schema.

**Deliverables** ✅

* Extend Supabase schema for new scientific fields across all three dimensions:

  **Recyclability (CR-v1):**
  * `CR_practical_mean`, `CR_practical_CI95`, `CR_theoretical_mean`, `CR_theoretical_CI95`
  * Parameters: `Y_value`, `D_value`, `C_value`, `M_value`, `E_value`
  
  **Compostability (CC-v1):**
  * `CC_practical_mean`, `CC_practical_CI95`, `CC_theoretical_mean`, `CC_theoretical_CI95`
  * Parameters: `B_value`, `N_value`, `T_value`, `H_value`, `M_value`
  
  **Reusability (RU-v1):**
  * `RU_practical_mean`, `RU_practical_CI95`, `RU_theoretical_mean`, `RU_theoretical_CI95`
  * Parameters: `L_value`, `R_value`, `U_value`, `C_value`, `M_value`
  
  **Shared metadata:**
  * `confidence_level`, `sources`, `whitepaper_version`, `method_version`, `calculation_timestamp`

* Preserve existing public fields for backward compatibility (`recyclability = CR_practical_mean * 100`).
* Add migration scripts and validate new endpoints.
* Ensure localStorage mirrors public data only for performance.

**Status:** Completed October 20, 2025. Currently only CR (Recyclability) fully implemented; CC and RU data fields planned.

### **2. Admin & Research Tools** ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Give administrators and researchers full control of scientific parameters.

**Deliverables** ✅

* Compute both $CR_{theo}$ and $CR_{prac}$ and write results to Supabase.
* Add confidence interval display and "show parameter detail" toggle.
* Create *Admin Source Manager* for editing JSON-based citation metadata.

  * Reduced-motion mode for users with vestibular disorders
  * Full ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
* ✅ Interactive opacity states (hover animations on halos)
* ✅ Tooltips showing practical/theoretical means, confidence intervals, and gap metrics
* ✅ Score bar colors (dimension-specific): Recyclability (yellow), Compostability (coral), Reusability (blue-gray)
* ✅ Documentation: `/whitepapers/VIZ-v1.md`, `/docs/VIZ_UNIFIED.md`

**Status:** Completed October 22, 2025. See `/docs/PHASE_4_VISUALIZATION_COMPLETE.md` for details.
