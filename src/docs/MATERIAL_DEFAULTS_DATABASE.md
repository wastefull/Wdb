- Require specialized recycling
- Cannot go in general waste

**PVC:**
- Contains plasticizers and additives
- Low T_value for CC (0.45)
- Avoid when alternatives exist

### **🌟 Champion Materials:**
**Glass, Aluminum, Steel:**
- Excellent for both recycling AND reuse
- Long lifetime + high recyclability
- Ideal for circular economy

**Food Waste:**
- Perfect for composting
- High biodegradation + good nutrients
- Should be diverted from landfill

**Cotton:**
- Natural fiber with good compostability
- High reusability (repair/upcycle culture)
- Moderate recyclability (fiber quality loss)
