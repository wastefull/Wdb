## Technical Implementation

### Email Flow for Approval/Rejection

```
Admin approves/rejects submission
  → ContentReviewCenter.handleApprove() or handleReject()
  → Update submission status in database
  → Process submission (publish material/article if approved)
  → Fetch submitter profile (email, name)
  → Call /email/approval or /email/rejection API
  → Server sends via Resend API
  → Toast notification confirms action + email status
  → User receives branded HTML email
```

### Manual Action Flow

```
Admin views Pending/Moderation tab
  → Sees submission cards with action buttons
  → Clicks "Remit to Review" (needs_revision only)
    → handleRemitToReview()
    → Updates status to 'pending_review'
    → Toast confirmation
    → Submission moves to Review tab
  
  OR clicks "Delete"
    → Confirmation dialog appears
    → handleDelete()
    → Calls DELETE /submissions/:id API
    → Removes from database
    → Toast confirmation
    → Submission disappears from list
```

## Summary

Phase 6.5 successfully implements:
- ✅ Professional approval email template (green theme, celebratory)
- ✅ Diplomatic rejection email template (pink theme, respectful)
- ✅ Automated email sending for all review actions
- ✅ "Remit to Review" functionality for revised submissions
- ✅ "Delete" functionality with confirmation dialogs
- ✅ Context-appropriate action buttons in each tab
- ✅ Graceful error handling for email failures

**Overall Progress:** 6.75 / 8 phases = **84.4% complete**

The notification and email system is now fully operational with complete coverage of all review workflows. Admins have powerful tools to manage submissions efficiently, and submitters receive professional, branded emails for every review action. The system handles errors gracefully and never blocks core functionality if email delivery fails.

With Phase 6 (Content Contribution System) now essentially complete, the platform is ready to move to Phase 7 (Research API & Data Publication), which will open WasteDB's data to researchers and external applications through a public REST API.
