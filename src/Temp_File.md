Without changing any files, please evaluate the following questions (if applicable, they will go into Backlog):

- Is there a way to manage my Supabase deployments and web stores from my app interface?
- What constraints would prevent me from replicating the Supabase management pages for my relevant deployments, web stores, and costs incurred in my own admin UI menus?

- For me to observe: does the dark mode app remember to stay in No Pastel mode?
- Better name for Evidence Wizard?
- Dark Mode still needs better colors
