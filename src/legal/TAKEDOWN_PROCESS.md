## Overview

WasteDB respects the intellectual property rights of authors, publishers, and copyright holders. If you believe content on WasteDB infringes your copyright, this document explains how to request removal or redaction.

**Email:** compliance@wastefull.org  
**Form:** [/legal/takedown](#) (web form available 24/7)

---

## ⚖️ Legal Framework

This process complies with:

- **United States:** Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) 17 U.S.C. § 512
- **European Union:** Copyright Directive (EU) 2019/790, Article 17
- **International:** Berne Convention principles

WasteDB operates under **fair use / fair dealing** principles for educational and research purposes, but we respect takedown requests and will evaluate each case individually.

## 📝 What Content Can Be Subject to Takedown?

### **Content Subject to Takedown:**

- ✅ Verbatim text snippets from your copyrighted work (stored in MIU records)
- ✅ Screenshots of figures, charts, or tables from your publication
- ✅ Extended quotations that exceed fair use limits

### **Content NOT Subject to Takedown:**

- ❌ Bibliographic metadata (title, authors, DOI, abstract) - factual information
- ❌ Numeric parameter values (facts not subject to copyright)
- ❌ Aggregated statistics derived from multiple sources
- ❌ Curator commentary or interpretations
- ❌ Source citations and references

**Note:** WasteDB extracts **minimal snippets** (typically 20-250 words) for scientific documentation, which generally qualifies as fair use. However, we will consider all legitimate requests.

## 🛠️ Resolution Options

Upon review, WasteDB will take one of the following actions:

### **1. Full Removal**

- Entire MIU deleted from database
- Snippet, screenshot, and metadata removed
- Aggregations recalculated without this MIU
- Public Evidence tab updated immediately

**When Applied:**

- Clearly excessive quotation (>250 words)

---

### **2. Partial Redaction**

- Snippet replaced with `[Redacted per copyright holder request - YYYY-MM-DD]`
- Screenshot removed
- Numeric value and metadata preserved (facts not copyrightable)
- Aggregations unchanged (derived statistics retained)
- Source citation remains with link to original

- Preserves scientific record while respecting copyright

---

### **3. Attribution Correction**

- Citation corrected to proper format
- Additional attribution added per copyright holder request
- "Copyright © [Year] [Holder]" notice added

**When Applied:**

- Content use is fair, but attribution inadequate

- Appeal process available

**When Applied:**

- Snippet <250 words, properly cited, educational purpose
- Screenshot low-resolution, used for scientific verification
- Transformative use (data extraction, not reproduction)

**Appeal Process:**

- Copyright holder may submit counter-arguments
- WasteDB will reconsider with additional context
- Final decision within 14 days
